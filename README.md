## üì¶ Dataset & Scraping

Since most Pakistani fashion brands do **not provide APIs**, I wrote **custom Python scripts using Selenium** to scrape product data such as:

- **Product Title**
- **Image**
- **Color**
- **Price**
- **Product Link**

Additionally, public datasets on Kaggle contained **only images and product titles**, so I could not use them directly. Therefore:

- ‚úÖ I **collected real-time product data** from brand websites (like Sapphire, Junaid Jamshed, etc.).
- ‚úÖ I wrote a **color detection script** to extract the dominant color from product images using Python and OpenCV/skimage libraries.

This allowed me to build a realistic product database with color-tagged clothing items to support the **color-matching** and **personalized palette** features in the app.
I have uploaded it on another repo https://github.com/Rabia-Sadiq/MyScrappers
